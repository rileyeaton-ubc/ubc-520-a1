# COSC 520: Advanced Algorithms - Assignment 1

## The Login Checker Problem

This repository is intended to store my assignment 1 submission for UBC COSC 520: Advanced Algorithms. It focuses on testing different algorithmic approaches to the login checker problem.

## Report

My final report for this assignment is available at [docs/report.pdf](docs/report.pdf)

## Dataset

I generated synthetic data using the `generate_logins.py` script, which can be found in [data/logins.txt](data/logins.txt)

## Replicating

1. Clone the repository and ensure you have Python 3
2. Run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `python generate_logins.py`

This script will use the dataset you cloned, but a new or larger one can still be generated using the script mentioned above, which is simply run the same way. The graphs generated from the tests in this script can be found under the `img` folder.
